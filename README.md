## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure and layout.
- **CSS3** for styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (optional)** if you decide to add dynamic behavior to the cart or login systems.
- **Font Awesome** for social media icons in the footer.

## Customization Instructions

1. **Product Images**: 
   - You can replace product images by simply updating the image files in the `images` folder and referencing them in the HTML.
   
2. **Styling**:
   - You can modify colors, fonts, and layout by editing the `styles.css` file under the `css` folder.

3. **Login and Signup**:
   - Currently, these pages are static. For functionality, you will need to implement a backend system (e.g., Node.js, PHP) and link it to a database to store user information.

## Future Enhancements

- **Backend Integration**: To make the cart and authentication system fully functional.
- **Checkout Page**: Add a page where users can enter shipping information and finalize their purchases.
- **Wishlist**: Store users’ wishlist items and display them under their profile.
